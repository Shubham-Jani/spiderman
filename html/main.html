                   Spider-Man is a superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in the anthology comic book 
            Amazing Fantasy 15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and in 
            movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised 
            by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the 
            character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson,
            Harry Osborn, Flash Thompson, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and Black Cat and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green 
            Goblin and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging
            to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter"
            devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.
